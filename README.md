# mirTox-App

This app aims to help analyze microRNAs within developmental toxicologically challenged human embryonic stem cells and integrate RNA-seq (of the same samples) to correlate microRNA regulation with target gene expression.

Identified microRNAs from this method may have the potential to be used as biomarkers to screen for early bone developmental defects.

The app is hosted [here](https://willdesi.shinyapps.io/mirTox-App/).
